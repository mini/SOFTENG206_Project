/**
 * -- NameSayerApp Class --
 *
 * NameSayerApp is the main entry point of the NameSayer application, containing
 * the main method as well as the hook start method that first initialises the
 * MainMenu scene on entry.
 *
 * The microphone icon in the main menu GUI was made by
 * https://www.flaticon.com/authors/prosymbols from www.flaticon.com.
 *
 * NameSayer is an application that allows the user to choose from a provided
 * database of names to practice. The user may select any number of names, and
 * for each name the user can choose to play the pronunciation, then record
 * their own recording and save. With their attempts, they can further compare
 * the two files to perfect their pronunciation of the names. Furthermore, files
 * in the database can be marked as 'Bad Quality' to allow a different version
 * to play. Other than the effective tool of practicing names, a microphone
 * testing tool is also featured for convenient access for the user.
